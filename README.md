# R Programming Language Syntax Checker using Python

The python programs use ‘ply’ library to tokenise and parse through a
given input and check whether it is part of the grammar (in this case, the
syntax of R programming language).
The syntax for the following five constructs is checked:
1. Variable Declaration
2. Array Declaration
3. If Construct
4. While Loop
5. Repeat (Do-While) Loop
